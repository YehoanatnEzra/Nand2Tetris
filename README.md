**Nand2Tetris - Complete Course Projects**  
This repository contains all 10 projects from the **Nand2Tetris** course, a hands-on journey from building logic gates to implementing a full computer system, assembler, virtual machine, and compiler. 

* Projects 1-5 are dedicated to creating a computer starting with Nand gate.
* projects 6-11 are dedicated to making a full compiler - from high langauge (Jack) all the way to hack machine code.

**Topics Covered:**  
* Boolean logic & combinational circuits  
* ALU & CPU design  
* Assembly language & assembler implementation  
* Virtual machine (VM) & translator  
* Compiler construction  
* Operating system essentials  

**Technologies Used:**
* HDL (Hardware Description Language)  
* Hack Assembly  
* Python for VM Translator & Compiler
